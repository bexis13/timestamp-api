# API BASEJUMP: TIMESTAMP MICROSERVICE

By Abose Ukhun

For [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)- [API Basejump: Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice)

## User Stories 
   1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether 
   that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date
   (example: January 1, 2016).
    
   2.  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural 
   language form of that date.
    
   3.  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null 
   for those properties.
